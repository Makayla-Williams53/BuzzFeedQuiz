# BuzzFeedQuiz

## Final for Advanced Java

This was my final for my high school Advanced Java class. We had to create a project that 
implemented and demonstrateted 6 of the 7 units that we had learned over the course of the 
year. I chose to do this in the form of a Buzz Feed Quiz. That way the user the can select 
and input answers to various questions, and in the end dependent on their answers a result 
to the original question will be displayed.

Requirements:
1) HTML/CSS is used
2) A Kanban board is used
3) Unit Tests are used
4) RegEx is used
5) Branching for each new feature
6) Databases are used 
7) A new Android Studio Element is implemented
